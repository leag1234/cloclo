# Archived milestone definitions and decisions

Moved from MISSION.md during M20; historical text below is preserved.

# MISSION — ATLAS-0

Build the PoC defined in `docs/13-poc-spec.md`, milestone by milestone, with each milestone proven by `make verify-mN` **green on GitHub CI** (not just locally).

Golden rule: a milestone only exists when its CI is green. Your word means nothing; the `ci` job means everything. You never modify `.github/workflows/` or `scripts/verify-*` (protected by CODEOWNERS).

The order is **mandatory**. M0 then M1 first: without CI and without reproducible infrastructure, everything else is unverifiable.

---

## M0 — Verifiable Framework
**Goal**: the verification loop runs end-to-end on an empty project.
**Deliverables**: service structure (skeletons), `make` target, CI executing lint+typecheck+tests+secret-scan, `eval-harness` capable of running empty.
**verify-m0** verifies: `make lint test` green; `make eval-smoke` executes (0 cases ok); an `edge-bff` healthcheck responds 200; the secret scan passes; the anti-model-name grep (docs/02 AC-ARC-4) finds nothing outside `services/model-gateway`.

## M1 — Reproducible GPU Infra + Gateway

**Goal**: prove that a GPU node is created by script, serves a model via vLLM, then is destroyed. Deliverables: `infra/gpu-up.sh`, `infra/gpu-down.sh`, config `services/model-gateway/`.

**verify-m1** validates ON THE VM (GPU access + Scaleway creds), NOT on GitHub CI (no GPU nor secrets). On CI: static control of scripts. On the VM, `make verify-m1` runs ONE cycle: creates the node, verifies vLLM responds on /v1/models, launches a control inference, archives a simple bench under BRAIN/bench/, destroys the node, all in under 20 min. The proof of M1 is the successful execution of `make verify-m1` on the VM. See contracts/m1.md.

## M2 — Ingestion + RAG
**Goal**: Hybrid RAG with resolvable citations.
**Deliverables**: ingestion (pdf/docx/md/html) → chunks + metadata + embeddings; BM25+dense+reranker search; generation with `chunk_id` citations.
If `evals/golden/` does not yet contain E1/E2/E3, run `generation/KIT-E1-E2-E3.md` on the provided corpus (status `genere-a-valider`, awaiting human validation).
**verify-m2** verifies on the multilingual corpus (corpus/): ingestion produces chunks with metadata; retrieval achieves **recall@8 ≥ 0.70** on the E1 golden set (M2 gate; target 0.85 eventually, adjustable via M2_RECALL_MIN); every citation in a response points to a chunk actually retrievable. M2 does not create a GPU.

## M3 — Agentic Harness + Web Tools
**Goal**: bounded tool loop, safe web search + reading.
**Deliverables**: state machine (hard budgets POC-P6), tools `web_search` (SerpApi), `web_fetch` (trafilatura, robots.txt, anti-SSRF), `rag_search`, `calculator`.
**verify-m3** verifies: POC-E4 ≥ 90%; SSRF tests (private IPs refused) + robots.txt + fetch ceiling; the 4 budgets trigger a clean stop (integration test); POC-E6 executable end-to-end.

## M4 — Cascade + UI + Escalation
**Goal**: S→L routing, fallback on GPU failure, UI connected.
**Deliverables**: routing classifier, escalation to Scaleway Generative APIs, UI (Open WebUI/LibreChat) connected to the gateway.
**verify-m4** verifies: POC-E8 ≥ 85%, zero under-routing on critical cases; fallback: if the local model is unreachable (simulated failure by cutting the local endpoint, WITHOUT creating a paid GPU), the gateway switches to Scaleway escalation and still responds. The UI (Open WebUI/LibreChat) is a visual PLUS, NON-blocking for this PoC gate.

## M5 — Full Evals + Telemetry
**Goal**: measure, compare, trace.
**Deliverables**: `make eval` (all suites, HTML report with diff + breakdown by language, < 20 min), calibrated judge (POC-R2), cost/latency dashboard, prefix-cache hit exposed.
**verify-m5** verifies: `make eval` complete green and under budget/time; report generated; telemetry metrics present (tokens, cost, TTFT, tok/s, cache hit).

## M6 — Hardening + Final Bench + GO/NO-GO Report
**Goal**: quantified proof for decision making.
**Deliverables**: load bench (POC-P1..P9), minimal input filter, `make demo` (full scenario), GO/NO-GO report auto-generated from measurements.
**verify-m6** verifies: POC-P1..P9 measured and archived; `make demo` runs a RAG + web + escalation journey without error; `reports/GO-NOGO.md` generated with real figures.

---

### Human Checkpoints (outside your responsibility, humans do these)
After M1 (infra/budget), after M3 (10 manual requests), after M5 (judge calibration), after M6 (decision). Between these points, you advance alone and log in BRAIN/.

### M1 — Protection Confirmation (Prerequisite AUTO-2 / POC-I1/I2 lifted)
Budget protections CONFIRMED and ACTIVE: Scaleway alerts at 50% and 80% of €800 (SMS + email), verified in console. GPU shutdown guaranteed by the trap in verify-m1.sh (destruction at end of test no matter what) and by the explicit call to gpu-down.sh. GPU type: automatic selection by gpu-up.sh (L40S-1-48G priority, available). The agent is AUTHORIZED to create a billed GPU to execute make verify-m1. This confirmation must not be requested again.

### M2 — Generation Engine Confirmed
For the RAG GENERATION step (drafting responses with citations), use the L model via Scaleway Generative APIs (ESCALATION_MODEL, already configured in .env, endpoint SCW_GENERATIVE_BASE_URL). The budget ceiling is ACTIVE and confirmed. The small CPU model serves ONLY for embeddings/reranking, not for generation. You are authorized to call Generative APIs to generate and produce reliable citations.

### M3 — Resumption Authorization (provider_error diagnosis)
The provider_error errors on E4-004/013/018 likely come from a truncated response (output token limit too low) when the context is long (fetched web page). You are AUTHORIZED to: (1) increase the gateway output token limit (e.g., 512 -> 2048), (2) truncate/summarize large web contents BEFORE passing them to the model (respecting context ceiling, docs/03 REQ-MOD-004), (3) retry E4/E6 attempts as many times as necessary within the per-request budget limit (€0.05). Scaleway function-calling is supported (official doc verified). Continue until E4 >= 90% then merge. Do not lower the E4 threshold, do not modify correction keys.

### M5 — Reference Judge for Cross-Calibration
The reference judge for cross-calibration is **gpt-oss-120b** (Scaleway Generative APIs, OpenAI family, distinct from the production judge glm-5.2 AND the system under test Qwen — independence of the 3 families is respected). Use the already configured Scaleway endpoint (SCW_GENERATIVE_BASE_URL, same key). Calculate Cohen's κ between glm-5.2 scores and gpt-oss-120b scores on the eval sample. No external access nor human judge required for the PoC; human calibration remains pre-GA.

### M5 — E9 Translation without FLORES (PoC)
Downloading FLORES-200 fails (mirror unavailable/authentication). For the PoC, the E9 suite uses ONLY cases already present in evals/golden/e9_traduction.yaml (written and validated business cases, false friends + terminology). Do NOT run fetch_flores.py, do not block on FLORES. The FLORES-200 extension is a post-PoC action. E9 is evaluated on available 'valide' cases.

### M5 — Calibration Fix (Judge JSON transport)
Scaleway's strict structured-output mode (response_format=json_object / json_schema) produces invalid doubly-encapsulated JSON (prefix `{"{"`). You are AUTHORIZED to:
1. NOT use strict json_schema/json_object mode for judge calls; request JSON in the prompt (text output) and parse it on the client side in a TOLERANT manner (extract the first valid JSON object {...} from the response, ignore potential wrapping). This is NOT "fixing a score": it is transport parsing, the judge's score is never modified.
2. Retry a bounded series of calls (budget < 3 EUR) to produce the calibration.
3. If a judge call remains unparsable after tolerant extraction, exclude it from the κ calculation and SIGNAL it in the report (best-effort calibration on valid cases).
The reference judge remains gpt-oss-120b (family independence preserved).

## M7 — Test UI + Interaction Observability
**Goal**: make the system queryable via a chat UI, with structured and exploitable logging of EVERY interaction, to analyze quality/latency/routing.

**Deliverables**:
- `make serve`: starts all necessary services in one command (http gateway + retrieval + adapter), without GPU by default (everything goes through Scaleway escalation; local GPU is activated only if GPU_LOCAL=1).
- **OpenAI-compatible Adapter**: exposes `POST /v1/chat/completions` (standard OpenAI protocol) and routes it to the internal pipeline (RAG /answer, web search, or escalation depending on request nature). Allows connecting any OpenAI client, including Open WebUI.
- **Open WebUI** in Docker, pointed at the adapter, accessible on port 3000 of the VM. The user opens http://<vm-ip>:3000 and chats with the system.
- **Structured logging per interaction**: each request produces a JSON line in `BRAIN/interactions/<date>.jsonl` with AT LEAST: timestamp, question, réponse, modèle_utilisé (local|escalade), route_decision (simple|complexe), latence_ms (retrieval, génération, total), chunks_récupérés (doc_id + score), citations (resolved chunk_id), tokens (in/out), coût_eur, any errors/timeouts. No secrets nor keys in logs.

**verify-m7** verifies: `make serve` starts services; the adapter responds to a `/v1/chat/completions` request end-to-end (response + citation); a structured log line is produced in BRAIN/interactions/ with required fields; Open WebUI is reachable (HTTP 200 on port 3000). Without GPU (escalation only) by default.

**Out of scope**: multi-user authentication, HTTPS, public exposure (port remains on VM; access via SSH tunnel or direct IP depending on network config).

## PoC v2 (M8→M13) — see docs/15-poc-v2.md

### GitHub Token Incident — ASSUMED RISK (human decision, 2026-09-10)
The GitHub token was exposed outside the VM. The project owner examined the risk and DECIDES not to revoke it for the duration of the PoC: scope limited to a private repo without sensitive data, prototyping context, rotation cost judged higher than residual risk. The incident is thus CLOSED as a blocker: this is not a revocation, it is an explicit and tracked risk acceptance.
Deferred action: rotate token before any production deployment.
The agent MUST NO LONGER block on this point nor ask for confirmation again.

### M13 — GPU Budget Attested (human decision, 2026-09-11)
The Scaleway consumption API is not readable by the project's IAM token; the budget is therefore ATTESTED here by the owner:
- Global monthly budget: €800; consumption to date: < €5; available margin: > €795.
- Hourly GPU ceiling: GPU_MAX_EUR_H=€2.00/h (the L40S is ~€1.47/h).
- GPU spending ceiling for M13: **€30 maximum** for the entire milestone.
- Active Scaleway budget alerts at 50% and 80% (SMS + email).
You are AUTHORIZED to create a GPU for M13 within these limits, provided you shut it down after each test (trap already in place). Do not query the billing API anymore: this attestation stands as proof.

### BUDGET RISK RULE (replaces any prior interpretation) — 2026-09-11
The financial risk related to the GPU is BOUNDED and ACCEPTED by the owner:
- hourly ceiling GPU_MAX_EUR_H = €2/h; M13 ceiling = €30; monthly budget €800;
  SMS+email alerts active at 50% and 80%. Worst case of a GPU forgotten overnight: ~€15.
- This risk is CONSCIOUSLY ASSUMED. A theoretical defect in shutdown (edge case of inventory, unlikely homonym, etc.) IS NOT a reason to stop: it is an improvement note to log in the report, then you CONTINUE.
- You are AUTHORIZED and REQUIRED to provision the GPU for M13, deploy Flux, test, then shut down with infra/gpu.py down. If shutdown returns an error, you log it and signal it — you do not block the milestone before having attempted it.
- Only remaining reasons to STOP: effective breach of ceiling (€30), secret leak, destructive action outside the strike-poc project, modification of a protected file. Preventive audit of shutdown scripts is NOT part of this.
Any new security objection regarding gpu.py/gpu-down must be PROPOSED in the report, never used to block. Provision.

## M16 — English localization of the public repository (PRIORITY)
**Context**: the repository is now PUBLIC. All documentation and code intended for external readers must be in English. This is a blocking presentation issue for an open-source project.

**Scope — TO TRANSLATE into English**:
- `README.md` — **to CREATE** (currently missing): project overview, architecture summary, quickstart (install, `make serve`, tunnel, UI), milestones, licence note. This is the first thing a visitor sees.
- `docs/*.md` (~2200 lines), `contracts/*.md` (~940), `runbooks/*.md` (~150)
- `MISSION.md`, `AGENTS.md`
- All comments, docstrings, log and error messages in `services/`, `scripts/`, `infra/`, `tests/` (~65 files contain French)

**Scope — MUST NOT be translated (French is intentional there)**:
- `corpus/` — the multilingual test corpus (7 languages) is the point of the test set
- `evals/golden/` — questions in FR/DE/ES/IT/AR/ZH are deliberate
- `BRAIN/` — local working journal, not tracked by git

**Constraints**: translation only — do NOT change behaviour, identifiers used by other code, file names, or test semantics. Keep commit messages and future PR titles in English.

**verify-m16** checks: README.md exists and is structured; no French function words in docs/contracts/runbooks/README/MISSION/AGENTS; no French in code comments/messages; and the multilingual corpus and golden sets are still intact (not translated away).

### M16 — Translation method (mandatory)
Do NOT build a segmentation/numbered-transport pipeline for translation. Translate each file DIRECTLY: read the file, produce the English version, write it back, one file at a time. No invariant validation, no concurrent calls, no cache layer. If a file is large, translate it in a few sequential passes over its sections, still writing plain text. Keep markdown structure, code blocks, links and anchors intact. Files to translate, in this order: README.md (create), runbooks/*.md, AGENTS.md, MISSION.md, contracts/*.md, docs/*.md. Commit after each file or small group.

## M17 — Integration: make existing capabilities actually usable (PRIORITY)

**Why this milestone exists.** M8–M15 are all "done": unit tests pass, CI is green,
every `verify-mN` succeeds. Yet a real user session found that **only one capability
out of seven works end to end**. Every `verify-mN` validated *components in isolation*,
never a *user journey* through the chat interface. A capability that answers a direct
function call but is unreachable from the UI is NOT delivered.

**New rule**: a milestone is "done" only when a **user journey through the public chat
API** proves it. Component tests are necessary, never sufficient.

### Defects found in the 2026-09-11 user session (all must be fixed)
1. **Language drift** — reply in English while the conversation was in French, after an
   image was sent. The vision path (likely also web and image paths) does not carry the
   conversation-language rule from `prompts/chat.txt`.
2. **Image generation fails** — a French request to create an image of a dancing dog →
   `stream_error`; UI shows "Uh-oh! There was an issue with the response."
3. **Projects unreachable** — M9 exists in the backend (`services/retrieval/project_api.py`)
   but a user cannot create or use a project from Open WebUI.
4. **Web search never returns a final answer** — UI shows two intermediate tool-call notices then nothing. Tools run; no answer is delivered.
5. **Auxiliary Open WebUI functions always fail** — title/tags/follow-up return
   `provider_error`/`cost`/`request_stopped` on every message. Either make them work
   (dedicated light model + own budget) or disable them with an explicit note.
   Silent permanent failure is not acceptable.
6. **`make serve` is not idempotent** — fails when containers or a previous `serving.py`
   process still exist. It must clean up its own resources first.

### Deliverables
- Fix defects 1–6.
- `tests/journeys/`: automated **user journeys** that call the **public chat API**
  (`POST /v1/chat/completions` on the adapter, exactly as the UI does) and assert on what
  the *user* receives. Internal function calls do not count as journeys.
- `make test-journeys` runs them and writes `BRAIN/eval/journeys.json`.
- **Live vs CI**: journeys needing the web, a provider or a GPU (J4, J6) run **live on the
  VM** and are **replayed from recorded cassettes in CI**. J4 must not create a GPU on
  every run: record once, replay afterwards; a live J4 run is explicit (`JOURNEYS_LIVE=1`).
- `make test-serve-idempotent` (J8) is a **separate** target, never part of the CI gate:
  it restarts the stack and must not run while a user session is active.

### Language criterion (explicit, so it cannot be gamed)
A reply "matches" the question language when a language detector (e.g. `langdetect`,
or a simple French/English function-word ratio) classifies the reply as the same
language as the last user message, with ≥ 0.8 confidence. Code blocks are excluded
from the check.

### Projects: realistic UI path
Open WebUI has no native "project" object. J5 is satisfied by ANY of these, as long as
a user can do it from the UI without editing files: (a) a project exposed as a dedicated
Open WebUI model with an attached knowledge base; (b) a chat command
(`/project create <name>`, `/project use <name>`) handled by the adapter; (c) an Open
WebUI tool/function. Document the chosen path in `runbooks/chat.md`.

### Journeys that must pass
J1 plain question → non-empty final answer, in the question's language.
J2 corpus question → answer with ≥ 1 resolvable citation.
J3 image sent → description, **in the conversation language**.
J4 a French request to generate an image of X → an image is returned (live on VM; cassette in CI).
J5 project → a fact stated in conversation A is used in conversation B of the same
   project; a different project does NOT see it.
J6 web question → tools run **and a final answer is delivered** (live on VM; cassette in CI).
J7 auxiliary calls (title/tags/follow-up) → no error, or explicitly disabled + documented.
J8 `make test-serve-idempotent` → second consecutive `make serve` succeeds (separate target).

**Nice to have (not blocking)**: expose the configured models distinctly (generalist,
code, vision) so Open WebUI's arena can compare them for the quality-evaluation phase.

**Definition of done**: `make verify-m17` passes. The gate itself performs a real call
to the public chat API and checks the reply; it does not trust the report alone.

### M17 — Decision: project-scoped image history (2026-09-11)
The leak you found is real and CORRECT to report: in `chat_pipeline.py`, any image in
the history triggers `process_vision` BEFORE `process_project`, and `vision.py` forwards
every client message to `/vision/complete` without project validation.

DECISION: images must be **scoped to the current project**, not refused.
- Resolve the project scope FIRST, then build the vision payload from messages belonging
  to the current project only. Reorder `process_project` before `process_vision`.
- `vision.py` must receive only in-scope messages; it must never receive history from
  another project (or from outside any project when a project is active).
- Journey J5 (`projects_isolated`) must cover this exact case: image in project Alpha,
  switch to Beta, ask a question → no Alpha content reaches vision. Keep
  `tests/test_project_vision_scope.py` as a permanent regression test.

You are AUTHORISED and REQUIRED to fix this yourself: `chat_pipeline.py` and `vision.py`
are your own, unprotected files. Finding a leak in your own code is not a reason to stop —
it is the work. Only stop if a PROTECTED file would have to change, or if fixing it would
require weakening isolation. Fix it, prove it with J5, then continue M17.


## M18 — Conversation integrity and image fidelity (user-test corrections)

Source: real user session of 2026-09-12. Capabilities now work individually, but the
**conversation breaks as soon as a non-text capability is involved**, and image
generation ignores explicit user constraints. Text-only multi-turn conversation is
confirmed working and must not regress.

### D1 — Follow-up after retrieval is treated as a new request (blocking)
Observed: after a RAG answer on an uploaded PDF, "translate what you just wrote into German" (asked in French) triggered a NEW retrieval ("Retrieved 1 source") then failed.
Required: a follow-up that refers to the assistant's previous answer ("translate that",
"summarise it", "shorter", "in German") must operate on the **previous turn**, not
re-enter retrieval/web/vision routing. Classify follow-ups before routing.

### D2 — `context_exceeded` after image generation (blocking)
Observed: after an image was generated, "you forgot the roller skates" (asked in French) returned
`context_exceeded`.
Cause: the generated image (base64 data URI) is kept in the conversation history sent to
the model. Required: store images **by reference**, never re-inject base64 into the model
context. A user must be able to iterate on a generated image ("add X", "same but Y").

### D3 — Intent ignored when an image is present
Observed: "could you edit this image?" (asked in French) produced an unsolicited description.
Required: the presence of an image must not force description. Read the request:
describe / analyse a specific point / extract text / compare / edit. Editing an existing
image is NOT supported by the current model: say so explicitly and offer what is
possible (describe, or generate a new image from a description). Never answer something
that was not asked.

### D4 — Premature give-up on web search timeout
Observed: a first web attempt timed out; the assistant answered "I could not obtain the
information" and redirected the user to news sites. On a second explicit request it
searched again and found a correct, sourced answer.
Required: at least one automatic retry (different phrasing or source) before giving up.
Only report failure after retries are exhausted, stating what was attempted.

### D5 — Interface labels in a random language
Observed: status labels ("Intermediate step completed: tool call" (displayed in French)) appeared in
French then in German within the same conversation.
Required: interface/status labels are FIXED strings, never produced or translated by the
model. Language of labels follows the UI locale, not the model output.

### D6 — Image generation ignores explicit constraints
Observed: "cat dancing with a dog, roller skates, pink sunglasses" (asked in French)
produced the animals and the pink glasses, no roller skates.
Diagnosis (confirmed in `services/model-gateway/image_worker.py` and `image-model.json`):
`unsloth/FLUX.1-schnell` with `num_inference_steps=4`, `512x512`,
`max_sequence_length=256` (which **TRUNCATES longer prompts** — the roller skates were at
the end of the sentence), fixed `manual_seed(42)` (same prompt always yields the same
image), and no prompt rewriting.

**DECISION: stay on FLUX.1-schnell** (Apache-2.0, freely usable commercially, no gated
download). FLUX.1-dev was considered and rejected for this PoC: it is gated on Hugging
Face and released under a **non-commercial licence**, which would block any production
use. Document this trade-off in `runbooks/`.

Required, within schnell's design:
- `max_sequence_length=512` — stop truncating prompts (primary suspected cause);
- `1024x1024` instead of 512x512;
- `num_inference_steps`: raise to the highest value that still helps on a distilled
  model (schnell is trained for few steps; measure 4 vs 8 and keep the better);
- **random seed** per generation, returned with the image so a user can reproduce one;
- **rewrite the user request into a structured English image prompt** before generation
  (subjects, attributes, scene, style), as mainstream systems do. This is the main lever
  left on a distilled model: log both the original and the rewritten prompt;
- `guidance_scale` stays 0.0: this is schnell's documented setting, NOT a defect;
- raise the worker watchdog from 85 s to 180 s to accommodate 1024x1024.
If, after these changes, explicit constraints are still dropped, report it with evidence
(prompt, rewritten prompt, seed, image) so the human can decide whether the licence cost
of FLUX.1-dev is worth paying. Do not silently accept a truncated prompt.

### Non-regression
Text-only multi-turn conversation, RAG with resolvable citations, web search with a final
sourced answer, vision description in the conversation language, dev API auth/quotas and
MCP confirmation must all keep working.

### Journeys (extend `tests/journeys/`, same rules as M17: public chat API only)
J9  RAG answer, then "translate your answer into German" (asked in French) → German translation of the
    PREVIOUS answer, no new retrieval, no error.
J10 image generated, then "add X" (asked in French) → a new image is returned, no `context_exceeded`.
J11 image sent with "can you edit it?" (asked in French) → explicit statement that editing is not
    supported + what is possible; NOT an unsolicited description.
J12 web search whose first attempt fails → automatic retry, final sourced answer.
J13 status labels are fixed strings in the UI locale across a whole conversation.
J14 image generation with three explicit constraints → the prompt is NOT truncated, is
    rewritten, uses a random seed and 1024x1024; a vision check reports how many of the
    three constraints are present, and the report records prompt, rewritten prompt, seed
    and the per-constraint result. A score below 3/3 does not fail the gate but MUST be
    reported as evidence for the model-choice decision.

**Definition of done**: `make verify-m18` passes; J1–J14 all pass through the public chat
API; the licence note is present.

### M18 — SerpApi availability confirmed (2026-09-13)
The three recorded SerpApi failures (timeout, search_unavailable, timeout) are
HISTORICAL evidence from an earlier session, not a current outage. Availability has been
verified by the owner: the account is healthy (Free plan, 244 searches remaining, 6 used
this month). The provider is WORKING.

Therefore: the "three technical failures" stop rule is RESET for SerpApi. Delete or
ignore BRAIN/m18-serpapi-failure.json as a blocking record, run the live journeys again
(fresh attempt counter), and continue. Never treat a stored failure from a previous
session as a reason to refuse a first attempt in the current session: the counter is
per-session, not permanent.

If SerpApi fails three times WITHIN THIS SESSION, record it and validate J6/J12 from
cassettes instead, then continue M18 — a transient search outage must not block the
whole milestone.

### Credential rotation completed (2026-09-13)
CONFIRMED by the owner: the exposed GitHub token has been REVOKED and replaced. The new
token is in secrets.env and in the git remote, with write access verified (API write
returned 201, delete returned 200). The incident is CLOSED. The new token was never
transmitted in clear text. Resume PR/CI/merge for M18; do not ask for this again.

## M19 — Explicit intent, explicit language, locked settings

Examples below are English glosses. The exact French acceptance inputs are
preserved in [the M19 journey cases](tests/journeys/m19-cases.json); tests must
use those originals, including their unaccented variants.

**Root cause.** A second real user session (2026-09-13, after M18) found three failures
that share ONE cause: **decisions taken upstream by heuristics are never carried through
to the model**. The model is then left to guess, and guesses wrong.

| Symptom observed | What actually happens |
|---|---|
| "draw me a five-legged sheep…" → a text answer, no image | a regex decides whether to generate; `image_request()` only matches a verb IMMEDIATELY followed by image/dessin/photo, so 3 natural phrasings out of 4 are missed |
| "I cannot draw images. I am a text assistant…" (with a redirect to DALL·E/Midjourney) | `prompts/chat.txt` declares NO capability (grep count = 0); the model sincerely believes it cannot |
| "describe this image" (French) → answer in English | `question_language()` correctly returns `fr`, but the result is only used to pick status LABELS; the detected language is never injected into the vision prompt |

### D1 — Let the MODEL decide when to generate an image
Replace the upstream regex with a declared tool, exactly like `web_search` and
`rag_search`, which work reliably.
- Declare `generate_image(prompt: str)` as a function/tool available to the model.
- Remove `image_request()` from the routing path (keep it only, if useful, as a cheap
  pre-hint — never as the sole gate).
- The model must handle: "draw me a sheep", "make me a portrait of X",
  "I would like to see a dragon", "generate an image of X", "can you depict…",
  and the English equivalents.
- It must NOT trigger generation for "analyze this image", "describe the attached image",
  "edit this image".

### D2 — Declare capabilities in the system prompt (and lock them)
`prompts/chat.txt` is 5 lines and mentions neither vision nor image generation. Restore
an explicit capability section: corpus retrieval with citations, web search and page
reading, exact calculation, **image analysis**, **image generation**, project memory,
MCP tools with confirmation. State plainly that the assistant DOES have vision and image
generation and must never claim otherwise nor redirect the user to third-party tools.
When a capability genuinely fails, say what failed — never "I cannot do this".

### D3 — Impose the detected language on every path
`question_language()` works but its result is discarded. Required:
- inject the resolved language explicitly into the prompt of EVERY path (chat, vision,
  web, image rewrite, follow-up): e.g. "Answer in French." — do not rely on the model
  inferring it from a three-word message;
- make detection robust to unaccented and uppercase French ("describe this image (unaccented French)"
  currently returns None); fall back to the conversation language, then to the UI locale,
  never to a hardcoded default;
- short messages (< 5 words) must inherit the conversation language.

### D4 — Lock the settings that already regressed twice
These values were silently lost before and nothing detects it. Add a permanent test
(`tests/test_settings_lock.py`, run in CI) asserting:
- `prompts/chat.txt` declares image analysis AND image generation;
- every prompt used by a model path carries a language instruction;
- `scripts/run_agent_auto.sh` waits 180 CI attempts (not 60);
- `image_worker.py`: `max_sequence_length=512`, `1024x1024`, variable seed,
  watchdog ≥ 180 s;
- `image-model.json` stays `FLUX.1-schnell` (Apache-2.0).
Any future change to these must break the test loudly, not silently.

### Journeys (extend `tests/journeys/`, public chat API only)
J15 "draw me a five-legged sheep dancing with a blue cow" → an image is
    returned (tool-driven, no regex).
J16 "make me a portrait of a cat" and "I would like to see a dragon" → images returned.
J17 "analyze this image" / "describe the image" → NO generation; a description instead.
J18 "can you generate images?" → a clear yes; never a redirect to DALL·E/Midjourney.
J19 "describe this image" (3-word French message, image attached) → description **in
    French**. Same test with an unaccented variant "describe this image (unaccented French)".
J20 a French conversation that includes a web search and an image generation → every
    answer AND every status label stays in French throughout.

**Non-regression**: everything validated by M17 and M18 (J1–J14) must keep passing.

**Definition of done**: `make verify-m19` passes; J1–J20 pass through the public chat
API; `tests/test_settings_lock.py` is part of the standard test run.

### M19 — External dependencies must not block delivery (2026-09-15)
M19 has been blocked three times by external services (GPU out of stock, then "SerpApi
timeouts") although its substance — imposed language, declared capabilities, tool-based
image routing, locked settings — depends on neither. SerpApi has been verified working by
the owner: HTTP 200 in 0.66 s, 229 searches left. The timeouts are therefore client-side.
Note: `services/orchestrator/web.py` uses `ClientTimeout(total=15)`, which covers search
AND page download; a heavy page exhausts it even though the search itself is instant.
Separate the budgets (connect / search / page read) and raise the page-read budget.

Rule: a journey depending on an external service (web search, image GPU) MAY be validated
from an existing cassette when the live attempt fails, PROVIDED the report declares, per
journey, whether it was `live` or `replay`. Replay is honest; silence is not. Never
fabricate a result. Milestone delivery must not wait for a third party.

## M20 archive boundary

The preceding historical text was moved from MISSION.md. Active requirements
remain in MISSION.md; future historical decisions are appended here.


## M20 delivered definition and M21 measurement record — archived 2026-09-17

## M20 — Real-usage journeys, honest failures, unified startup

Source: owner sessions of 2026-09-13 and 2026-09-15. Exact acceptance inputs and
language variants are preserved in [the journey cases](tests/journeys/m20-cases.json).
Requirements: REQ-ENG-004/005/009/011, REQ-INF-012/013, REQ-FIN-002 and POC-P6.

### Journey rules (permanent)

R1: Write a one-sentence user intent and at least six natural phrasings before
examining implementation. Do not derive wording from regexes or prompt templates.

R2: For each capability include six phrasings, three without the obvious keyword,
a message of at most four words, unaccented and uppercase input, English and another
language, and a negative case. For attachments include at least two in one request.

R3: Assertions describe useful content received by the user, not internal function
calls or routing flags. An assertion that passes with no useful answer is invalid.

R4: Preserve every owner-reported defect as a permanent, verbatim, dated journey;
never rephrase it to make it easier.

R5: A service module called only from tests is not delivered. Unreachable modules
must fail the gate, not merely produce a warning.

R6: Every rejection identifies measured values and thresholds, in plain user-facing
language and the server journal. Never conflate image byte limits with model token
limits. Preserve the user's question when it can be safely parsed.

### Defects and deliverables

D1: Two attached images are rejected with a misleading context error and an empty
question in the journal. Instrument and reproduce before fixing. Earlier guesses
about base64 reinjection, context size and malformed dimensions were wrong.
Support several attachments; two 1024x1024 images normally fit the vision context.

D2: Requests to edit or combine existing pictures must explicitly say that editing
and compositing are unsupported, and offer image description or generation from a
text description. Never substitute an unsolicited description or a silent error.

D3: Every generation logs the original request, rewritten prompt, seed, model,
resolution and steps so disappointing output can be diagnosed and reproduced.

D4: For the owner's sheep-and-cow request, check that the rewrite preserves every
attribute on both subjects, particularly pink glasses on both. Report actual
per-constraint visual evidence. If the rewrite is correct but the generated image
misses constraints, report a model limitation. Five-legged anatomy is a known
limitation, not something to claim fixed without evidence.

D5: Users must not need a separate GPU provisioning or serve-imagegen command.
When generate_image is called and the worker is down, provision on demand, tell
the user it is starting with the expected wait, and deliver the image. Preserve
automatic shutdown after inactivity and all cost protections.

D6: Every service validates required configuration before startup side effects.
Missing variables must produce an explicit list, never a hang or KeyError.
The permanent settings lock includes those required-variable lists.

D7: gpu-up announces creation only after confirming that the instance exists.
Report real categories such as unavailable stock, quota or missing configuration;
never leak raw provider diagnostics or announce success before creation.

E1: Do not re-verify completed milestones (see permanent constraints).
E2: Keep MISSION.md under 8,000 bytes; move settled material without deleting it
to the append-only decisions log, which is not reread every session.

### Required public journeys

| Journey | User-visible acceptance |
|---|---|
| J21 | Two pictures plus the original compositing request: honest unsupported answer, no context error |
| J22 | Compare two pictures: meaningful comparison using both |
| J23 | Original edit question with one picture: honest unsupported answer (2026-09-13) |
| J24 | Original multi-subject drawing: generated image, recorded prompt/rewrite/seed and per-constraint assessment (2026-09-15) |
| J25 | Drawing with worker down: startup notice, automatic provisioning and image delivery |
| J26 | Missing required variable: explicit startup refusal naming it |

Definition of done: make verify-m20 passes locally and on GitHub CI; J1–J26 pass
through the public chat API; MISSION.md stays under 8,000 bytes and the decisions
log exists. Record the approved merge and completion in BRAIN. No unmeasured image
quality claim or replay presented as live evidence is acceptable.


## M21 — Close the quality gap: reasoning, expertise, full context, clear UI

Source: comparison corpus built on 2026-09-17 from three real conversations run in
parallel on ChatGPT and on ATLAS (guitar chord from a photo; Amstrad CPC / Z80 throughput;
pinhole solargraphy from a web article). On all three, ATLAS was **factually correct**. On
all three, ChatGPT was **noticeably deeper**. Every cause of the gap was measured and none
of them is a model limitation.

| Case | ATLAS behaviour | Measured cause |
|---|---|---|
| Guitar chord photo | described finger positions, added a disclaimer | `prompts/vision.txt` says "describe only what is visible" — it asks for description, not expertise |
| Z80 throughput | correct figures, no derivation | `reasoning_effort: none`; ChatGPT "worked for 1m 29s" |
| Solargraphy article | honest "the retrieved text is truncated", then generic answer | `tools.py:189` keeps **2 000 bytes** of a 400 kB page |
| RAG in general | thin citations | `retrieval/tool.py:31` keeps **400 bytes** per chunk |

Principle (unchanged since docs/15): approach frontier behaviour, never excuse. Truncating
silently is an excuse; so is describing when the user asked a question.

---

### D1 — Effort switch: two levels, measured parameters
`reasoning_effort` IS supported by `qwen3.5-397b-a17b` on Scaleway (verified: the reply
carries a `reasoning` field). Measurements on a hard Z80 question:

| effort | max_tokens | trace | answer | tokens used |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| none | 3 000 | 0 | 6 888 chars | 2 069 |
| high | 6 000 | 17–23 k | **0 (empty)** | 6 000 (saturated) |
| high | 10 000 | 23 927 | 5 386 chars | 9 145 |
| high | 16 000 | 25 614 | 5 448 chars | 9 731 |

`low` / `medium` / `high` were indistinguishable on two questions: expose **two** levels,
not three. Reasoning and answer share `max_tokens`: an undersized budget yields an EMPTY
answer, which is worse than no reasoning.

Required:
- Expose two models in the adapter and in Open WebUI's selector: **`atlas`** (standard:
  `reasoning_effort=none`, `max_tokens=3000`, budget 0.05 EUR) and **`atlas-deep`**
  (`reasoning_effort=high`, `max_tokens=16000`, budget 0.10 EUR). Same routing, same
  tools, same prompts otherwise.
- Never return an empty `content` because the trace consumed the budget: if `content` is
  empty and `finish_reason` is `length`, retry once with `reasoning_effort=none` and say
  so in the status.
- Show the reasoning trace as a **collapsed** block ("Réflexion", expandable) above the
  answer — it is longer than the answer and must never bury it.
- Log per request: effort, tokens for trace and for answer, cost.

### D2 — Prompts must ask for expertise, not description
`prompts/vision.txt` ("Describe only what is visible and state uncertainties") produces an
inventory of finger positions where ChatGPT produced a chord name, a tablature, the notes
and a conclusion. Rewrite `prompts/chat.txt`, `prompts/vision.txt`, `prompts/web-chat.txt`,
`prompts/rag.txt`:
- answer the QUESTION as a domain expert would; an attached image or document is evidence,
  not the subject of the answer;
- use the domain's native formats when they help (tablature, code, tables, formulas);
- show the derivation when the answer rests on one (calculations, timings, unit
  conversions), and anticipate the obvious objection;
- conclude explicitly; never end on a reflexive disclaimer ("positions may vary…");
- keep honesty about uncertainty, but as a precise statement, not a hedge.
Keep the safety rules of the existing prompts (untrusted image text, no fabricated sources).

### D3 — Full context reaches the model; long content is synthesised, never cut
- `services/orchestrator/tools.py:189` — web page text is cut to 2 000 bytes. Remove the
  cut. Deliver the **whole extracted text** when it fits the tool budget; when it does not,
  run the M10 hierarchical synthesis on it and deliver the synthesis plus the passages that
  answer the question. The `"truncated"` flag must become rare and must always be visible
  to the user when true.
- `services/retrieval/tool.py:31` — RAG chunks are cut to 400 bytes. Deliver whole chunks;
  size the retrieval budget by tokens, not by a per-chunk byte cap.
- Web fetch: the page is downloaded whole (MAX_BYTES 2 MB is fine). Extraction must run
  before any size decision, and the decision must apply to extracted text, not raw HTML.
- Verbatim journey: fetch
  `https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/longest-known-exposure-pinhole-uk`
  (no paywall; 400 859 bytes; contains "Ilford", "Bayfordbury", "cider", "Multigrade")
  and answer "comment fabriquer ce type de camera" → the answer must mention at least three
  of those four details. Today it mentions none.

### D4 — Images by reference (the real fix behind the 32 MB limit)
Raising the request-body limit from 6 to 32 MB (commit 601a548) unblocked two phone
photos; it does not fix the cause. Open WebUI re-sends every attached image as base64 on
every turn. Store uploaded images once (`image_store.py` already exists for generated
ones), replace them by references in the history sent to the model, and re-materialise
only the ones the current turn needs. Journey: ten turns, one photo each, no size error.

### D5 — UI: show what is happening, say what the tool did, make questions readable
- **Live activity indicator.** In deep mode the model can think for a minute before any
  text appears; today the screen shows nothing and the user cannot tell the system from a
  frozen one. Stream a visible state from the first moment: an animated indicator with the
  current activity (verbatim multilingual labels: tests/journeys/m21-cases.json) and an elapsed-time counter. It must appear within 2 s of the request and
  update at every state change, including while the reasoning trace is being produced.
- **Name the tool.** "Étape intermédiaire terminée : appel d'outil" is uninformative. Show
  **which** tool ran (recherche web, lecture de page, calcul, génération d'image…), and for
  web tools the URL(s) consulted, in a collapsible block — the way ChatGPT's "Worked for
  21s" expands into its steps.
- **Readable questions.** User messages render in near-white grey and are hard to read.
  Give them a distinct background: **green**, consistent with e/OS identity.

### Journeys (verbatim, public chat API)
J27 `atlas-deep` on the Z80 question → non-empty answer containing OUTI/OTIR timings and a
    derivation; trace present and collapsed; cost logged.
J28 `atlas-deep` with a deliberately small budget → no empty answer (fallback applied and
    stated).
J29 guitar photo + original question (verbatim: tests/journeys/m21-cases.json) → a chord name, a
    tablature or fret list, the notes, a conclusion; no "positions may vary" ending.
J30 National Geographic article → ≥ 3 of the 4 detail keywords present in the answer.
J31 RAG question whose answer sits beyond byte 400 of its chunk → answered with citation.
J32 tool steps → each step names the tool; web steps list URLs.
J33 any request → an activity indicator appears within 2 s and names the current activity;
    in deep mode it stays visible and updated during the whole reasoning phase.

### Non-regression
Everything validated by M17–M20 (J1–J26). `atlas` (standard) must keep its current speed
and cost.

**Definition of done**: `make verify-m21` passes; J1–J32 pass through the public chat API;
the four measured causes above are gone (no 2 000-byte cut, no 400-byte cut, expertise
prompts in place, two effort levels exposed).



## M21 budget decision history preserved 2026-09-17

### Budget exception — owner decision 2026-09-17
AUTHORIZED: deep/high0.10 EUR per request supersedes docs/13 POC-P6; all other paths
retain0.05 EUR. Measured deep output9700 tokens costs~0.035 EUR at3.60 EUR/M;
0.05 EUR reservations reject heavy requests. This owner exception is authoritative;
do not block on this contradiction.


### Budget raised for full-context tool chains (owner decision, 2026-09-17) — supersedes ALL earlier per-request caps
AUTHORIZED, and this is now the single authoritative statement of per-request caps:
- `atlas` (standard): **0.10 EUR** per request (was 0.05).
- `atlas-deep`: **0.20 EUR** per request (was 0.10).
Any lower figure in docs/13, in earlier MISSION entries or in code comments is SUPERSEDED.
Do not stop on a contradiction with those older figures; apply these.

Rationale, measured on 2026-09-17: removing the 2 000-byte web cut and the 400-byte RAG cut
(M21/D3) multiplied the context carried through a tool chain. A question that triggers five
tools now costs ~0.069 EUR in deep mode and exceeded the old caps BEFORE the answer was
produced — including in standard mode. The caps had been sized for truncated content; they
must be sized for full content, which is the whole point of this milestone.

Cost control stays in place: tool-call count limits, wall-clock deadlines (120 s standard,
300 s deep) and the monthly budget with alerts are unchanged. If a request still exceeds
0.20 EUR, that is a genuine signal — report it with the measured breakdown rather than
silently truncating context again.


## M21 owner directives before condensation, 2026-09-17

# MISSION — ATLAS-0

Build [docs/13](docs/13-poc-spec.md); read AGENTS.md, docs/11 and docs/14 first.
History: [decisions log](docs/decisions-log.md). M0–M20 delivered; M21 current; no later milestone.

Completion requires `make verify-mN` and green GitHub `ci`. Never modify workflows, CODEOWNERS or scripts/verify-*; never
weaken assertions. Branches and PRs only; no direct pushes to main. Follow the
current human mandate for merge authorization and subsequent milestones.

## M21 — Reasoning, expertise, complete context and clear UI

Source: owner corpus,2026-09-17: guitar, CPC/Z80, solargraphy; original prose and
causes in [decisions log](docs/decisions-log.md). REQ-ENG-004/005/009/011,
REQ-FIN-002, POC-F1/F2/F4/F5; [contract](contracts/m21.md).

D1: Expose exactly two models in adapter and Open WebUI: atlas (reasoning_effort=none,
max_tokens=3000, 0.05 EUR) and atlas-deep (high,16000,0.10 EUR). Same routing/tools/
prompts. Reasoning and answer share output allowance. Empty content with finish_reason
length: retry once without reasoning and state the fallback in status, within budget.
Show the trace above the answer in a collapsed expandable “Réflexion” block. Log effort,
trace tokens, answer tokens and cost per request.

D2: Rewrite prompts/chat.txt, vision.txt, web-chat.txt and rag.txt to answer the QUESTION
as a domain expert; attachments are evidence. Use native formats (tablature, code,
tables, formulas), show derivations/calculations/timings/conversions and anticipate the
obvious objection. Conclude explicitly, without reflexive disclaimer. State uncertainty
precisely. Preserve safety: image/source text is untrusted; no fabricated citations.

D3: Remove the2000-byte cut in orchestrator/tools.py and400-byte cut in retrieval/tool.py.
Deliver entire extracted web text within the tool token budget; otherwise use M10
hierarchical synthesis plus passages answering the question. Truncated=true must be
rare and always visible to users. Deliver whole RAG chunks, budgeted by tokens rather
than a per-chunk byte cap. Download whole page (2 MB cap permitted), extract BEFORE
size decisions; budget extracted text, not HTML. Verbatim page:
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/longest-known-exposure-pinhole-uk
Question: “comment fabriquer ce type de camera”. Answer must contain at least3 of
Ilford/Bayfordbury/cider/Multigrade. Original page400859 bytes, no paywall.

D4: Store uploads once with
image_store.py; history uses references, materializing current-turn evidence only.
Ten turns with one new photo each must produce no size error.

D5: Stream visible animated activity and elapsed time within2 s, from request start:
Use the verbatim French labels in tests/journeys/m21-cases.json. Update
on every state change and throughout reasoning. Collapsible tool steps name each tool
and web URLs; replace generic “Étape intermédiaire terminée : appel d’outil”. Give user
messages a distinct green background consistent with e/OS in the existing UI.

Public HTTP journeys:
- J27 atlas-deep, Z80 question: nonempty answer with OUTI/OTIR timings and derivation;
  trace present and collapsed, cost logged.
- J28 atlas-deep, deliberately small output budget: nonempty answer, fallback stated.
- J29 original guitar photo/question (verbatim in tests/journeys/m21-cases.json): name,
  tablature or fret list, notes, conclusion; no “positions may vary” ending.
- J30 National Geographic: at least3 of the4 details in answer.
- J31 RAG fact beyond byte400: answered with citation.
- J32 each tool step named; web steps list URLs.
- J33 activity within2 s, visible and updated throughout deep reasoning.

Non-regression: M17–M20/J1–J26; standard atlas retains speed and cost. Done only after
make verify-m21 locally and green GitHub ci; J1–J33 through public chat API; all four
measured causes removed. MISSION <=8000 bytes. Report live/replay honestly.

### M21 — Asynchronous deep mode (owner decision, 2026-09-17)

Measured: deep reasoning took~96s;120s caused incorrect recovery. Standard
answered correctly; deep used another platform's18/23-cycle timings.

1. **Deadline:** atlas-deep300s; atlas120s. D5 activity starts within the first
second, names the phase (“Réflexion…”) and displays elapsed time throughout.
Correctness takes priority.
2. **Recovery:** on deep failure/timeout, rerun the question without reasoning
with the full prompt and context, within the budget. Return the complete answer
and state that deep did not complete. Never salvage an interrupted derivation.
3. **Correctness:** J27 must verify correct timings and derivation. Compare both
profiles on the same question; report lower deep accuracy honestly, never force
an assertion to pass.

### Authoritative request budgets — owner decision 2026-09-17

AUTHORIZED: atlas0.10 EUR/request; atlas-deep0.20 EUR/request. These supersede ALL
older per-request figures in docs/13, MISSION, contracts and code. Full-context
chains measured~0.069 EUR; prior caps assumed truncated evidence. Keep10-tool and
120s/300s deadlines, monthly budget and alerts. If0.20 EUR is exceeded, report the
measured breakdown; never silently truncate evidence. Original decisions preserved
unchanged in docs/decisions-log.md.

### Provider default changed: always send `reasoning_effort` explicitly (owner finding, 2026-09-17)
Root cause of the repeated empty answers that blocked M21 (acquisitions 2 and 3 returned
41/37 output tokens with no text, no trace, no tools): **Scaleway changed the default**.
Measured today on `qwen3.5-397b-a17b`, same prompt, same model:
- `reasoning_effort` OMITTED → 8 422 chars of trace, 354 chars of answer, 2 369 tokens.
- `reasoning_effort: "none"` sent explicitly → 0 trace, 467 chars of answer, 123 tokens.
With the old 800-token budget the default reasoning consumed everything and `content` came
back empty, which the gateway correctly rejected.

Rule: the gateway MUST send `reasoning_effort` explicitly on every provider call —
`"none"` for `atlas`, `"high"` for `atlas-deep`. Never rely on the provider default.
Add a regression test asserting the parameter is present in every outgoing request.

Defensive measure: if `content` comes back empty while `reasoning` is non-empty, that is a
provider-default regression, not a model failure. Log it as such, retry once with
`reasoning_effort: "none"`, and report the incident rather than returning an empty answer.

This is an external change, not an implementation defect: the earlier J27/J29 "quality"
rejections must be re-evaluated once the parameter is sent explicitly.

### Never assume the shape of a provider reply (owner principle, 2026-09-17)
M21 was blocked for hours because the gateway assumed an answer would arrive in `content`.
Scaleway changed its default and the text went to `reasoning` instead, so the pipeline saw
empty answers and stopped. The lesson is NOT about where the model runs — a self-hosted
model can return an empty, truncated or oddly shaped reply just as easily. The lesson is
that the system must **verify** what it received instead of assuming it.

Rule for every provider call (text, vision, image, embeddings, tools):
- Treat the reply as untrusted data. Validate its shape before using it.
- Handle explicitly: empty `content`; text delivered in an unexpected field; `finish_reason`
  of `length` or `content_filter`; missing `usage`; malformed or double-encoded JSON;
  partial or interrupted streams; HTTP success with an error body.
- On any of these, do not fail silently and do not invent a fallback answer. Log what was
  actually received (fields present, sizes, finish_reason, tokens), apply a defined recovery
  (explicit parameters, one retry, alternate model), and surface the incident.
- Send every parameter that affects behaviour explicitly — `reasoning_effort` above all.
  Provider defaults change without notice and must never be relied upon.
- Add regression tests that feed the gateway these malformed replies and assert it degrades
  gracefully with a clear message, rather than returning nothing.

## M21 — Reasoning, expertise, complete context and clear UI

Source: owner corpus2026-09-17; history in decisions-log. REQ-ENG-004/005/009/011,
REQ-FIN-002, POC-F1/F2/F4/F5; [contract](contracts/m21.md).

D1: Expose exactly two models in adapter and Open WebUI: atlas (reasoning_effort=none,
max_tokens=3000, 0.10 EUR) and atlas-deep (high,16000,0.20 EUR). Same routing/tools/
prompts. Reasoning and answer share output allowance. Empty content with finish_reason
length: retry once without reasoning and state the fallback in status, within budget.
Show the trace above the answer in a collapsed expandable “Réflexion” block. Log effort,
trace tokens, answer tokens and cost per request.

D2: Rewrite prompts/chat.txt, vision.txt, web-chat.txt and rag.txt to answer the QUESTION
as a domain expert; attachments are evidence. Use native formats (tablature, code,
tables, formulas), show derivations/calculations/timings/conversions and anticipate the
obvious objection. Conclude explicitly, without reflexive disclaimer. State uncertainty
precisely. Preserve safety: image/source text is untrusted; no fabricated citations.

D3: Remove the2000-byte cut in orchestrator/tools.py and400-byte cut in retrieval/tool.py.
Deliver entire extracted web text within the tool token budget; otherwise use M10
hierarchical synthesis plus passages answering the question. Truncated=true must be
rare and always visible to users. Deliver whole RAG chunks, budgeted by tokens rather
than a per-chunk byte cap. Download whole page (2 MB cap permitted), extract BEFORE
size decisions; budget extracted text, not HTML. Verbatim page:
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/longest-known-exposure-pinhole-uk
Question: “comment fabriquer ce type de camera”. Answer must contain at least3 of
Ilford/Bayfordbury/cider/Multigrade. Original page400859 bytes, no paywall.

D4: Store uploads once with
image_store.py; history uses references, materializing current-turn evidence only.
Ten turns with one new photo each must produce no size error.

D5: Visible animated activity + elapsed time from request start (within1s); use exact
French labels in tests/journeys/m21-cases.json. Update each state and during reasoning.
Collapsible steps name tools and web URLs; replace generic intermediate-step text.
User messages get distinct e/OS green background in existing UI.

Public HTTP journeys:
- J27 atlas-deep, Z80 question: nonempty answer with OUTI/OTIR timings and derivation;
  trace present and collapsed, cost logged.
- J28 atlas-deep, deliberately small output budget: nonempty answer, fallback stated.
- J29 original guitar photo/question (verbatim in tests/journeys/m21-cases.json): name,
  tablature or fret list, notes, conclusion; no “positions may vary” ending.
- J30 National Geographic: at least3 of the4 details in answer.
- J31 RAG fact beyond byte400: answered with citation.
- J32 each tool step named; web steps list URLs.
- J33 activity within2 s, visible and updated throughout deep reasoning.

Non-regression: M17–M20/J1–J26; standard atlas retains speed and cost. Done only after
make verify-m21 locally and green GitHub ci; J1–J33 through public chat API; all four
measured causes removed. MISSION <=8000 bytes. Report live/replay honestly.

### Authoritative owner decisions — 2026-09-17

Budgets supersede ALL older figures in docs/13, MISSION, contracts and code:
**atlas0.10 EUR/120s; atlas-deep0.20 EUR/300s;10 tools**. Full-context chains
measured~0.069 EUR. Monthly budget and alerts remain. Report the measured breakdown
if0.20 EUR is exceeded; never silently truncate evidence.

Deep activity starts within1s, names the phase (“Réflexion…”) and displays elapsed
time throughout. Correctness takes priority. On deep timeout/failure, rerun the
full prompt/context without reasoning within the same ledger. Return its complete
answer and state deep did not complete; never salvage an interrupted derivation.
Compare both profiles on the same question; report lower deep accuracy honestly.

Always send reasoning_effort explicitly on provider generation calls: none for
atlas and high for atlas-deep, none for recovery. Never depend on provider defaults.
Owner measured omitted effort consuming output on reasoning; explicit none returned
content. Re-evaluate earlier quality rejections after fixing transport. Unsupported capabilities select a configured compatible alternate.
Empty content with nonempty reasoning is a provider-default regression: log it,
retry once with explicit none within budget and surface the incident.

Treat every provider reply (text, vision, image, embeddings, tools) as untrusted.
Validate shape; explicitly handle empty content, unexpected text fields, length or
content_filter finishes, missing usage, malformed/double-encoded JSON, interrupted
streams and HTTP success with an error body. Never silently fail or invent an answer.
Log observed fields/sizes/finish/tokens without secrets, apply defined bounded
recovery and surface the incident. Explicitly send behavior-affecting parameters.
Regression tests must cover outgoing effort and malformed replies with clear errors.
Original owner prose and measured diagnoses preserved unchanged in decisions-log.

### Reasoning mode: negative result confirmed on all three provider models (2026-09-17)
Same hard Z80 question, `max_tokens` 12 000, `reasoning_effort` explicit:
| model | none | high |
|---|---|---|
| qwen3.5-397b | 6 888 chars, 2 069 tok | wrong timings, then empty answers, then tool JSON |
| glm-5.2 | 4 563 chars, 1 413 tok, 40 s | **non-JSON reply** after 107 s |
| deepseek-v4-flash | 4 628 chars, 1 489 tok, **19 s** | 42 081 chars of trace, **0 chars of answer**, 12 000 tok saturated, 204 s |
Reasoning mode is unusable on this provider regardless of model. Standard mode works on
all three. Record this table in `reports/M21.md`. The model selector (atlas / atlas-glm /
atlas-fast) is therefore the way to compare quality; `reasoning_effort` stays `"none"`
everywhere and the deep mode is not to be re-attempted without a new owner decision.
