# Project ATLAS — Sovereign LLM Platform on Open-Weight Models

> Normative reference corpus. These documents are authoritative over the code.

## 0. Objective

Build a conversational and agentic platform of "frontier" quality
based on **open-weight** models, first for **internal enterprise** use,
then extensible to a multi-tenant product.

Structuring constraint: **minimal infrastructure cost for a given quality**.
The default decision is therefore *not to host GPUs unless the load justifies it*
(cf. `04-finops.md`, calculated switching threshold).

## 2. Normative Conventions (RFC 2119)

- **MUST**: Blocking. A PR violating a MUST is rejected by CI or review.
- **SHOULD**: Default; a deviation requires written justification in the PR.
- **MAY**: Implementation latitude.

Each requirement carries a stable identifier `REQ-<DOMAIN>-<n>`. Code, tests,
and tickets **MUST** reference the identifier (`// covers: REQ-INF-004`).

## 3. Guiding Principles

1. **Contracts first.** No code before the contract (OpenAPI / JSON Schema /
   protobuf) is merged. Agents generate code *from* the contract.
2. **The model is replaceable.** No component outside the `model-gateway` layer
   knows the name of a model. A provider change = a config change.
3. **Cost = first-class function.** Any PR touching the inference path
   declares its impact `€/1k requests` (cf. `04-finops.md`).
4. **Nothing goes to prod without eval.** The quality gate (`09`) is blocking.
5. **Determinism and reproducibility.** Seeds, pinned versions, immutable artifacts.
6. **The hardest part is not serving, it's behavior.** Budget and attention
   must be allocated accordingly: ~20% infra, ~50% harness + evals, ~30% post-training.

## 4. Explicit Anti-Goals

- Do not pre-train a base model. Ever.
- Do not build a generic homegrown agent framework. We assemble.
- Do not aim for full multimodal parity in phase 1.
- Do not optimize latency before having a measured and violated SLO.
